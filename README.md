# Complex-Fourier
---------------
Complex Fourier Series tranforms every drawing (or more technically every closed contour) to a series of rotating vectors along with thier complec coefficients.

this code calculates Fouriers Series Coefficients and then plot the given figure as a sum of differents rotating vectors.

I aslo strongly recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k&t=1334s) where [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) clearly explains the the whole concept.
